# Welcome to Hugs

You just created a site — and you're already looking at it. This is the documentation, but it's also yours. Change it, delete it, build something new.

> **Tip:** You can always get back here by running `hugs doc` in your terminal.

## What you're looking at

This page comes together from four pieces:

1. **Header** at the top — lives in `_/header.md`
2. **Navigation** just below — that's `_/nav.md`
3. **Content** (what you're reading) — this file, `index.md`
4. **Footer** at the bottom — `_/footer.md`

Every page works this way. The header, nav, and footer stay consistent — only the content swaps out.

{% call tryit() %}
Open `index.md`, change something, save. The page reloads on its own.
{% endcall %}

When you're ready, the [About page](/about) shows you how to make new pages.
