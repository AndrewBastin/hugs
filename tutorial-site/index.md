# Hey there!

Welcome to the Hugs documentation! I'm the homepage, and I'll help you learn how to build sites with Hugs.

> **Tip:** You can open this documentation anytime by running `hugs doc` in your terminal!

## How This Page Works

Take a look around - this page has four parts:

1. **Header** - The bit at the very top with the site name. I get that from `_/header.md`.
2. **Navigation** - The links just below. Those come from `_/nav.md`.
3. **Content** - You're reading it! This is me, `index.md`.
4. **Footer** - Down at the bottom. That's `_/footer.md`.

Every page on your site follows this same structure. The header, nav, and footer stay consistent - only the content area changes based on which page you're viewing.

Try editing me right now - open `index.md` and change something. The page will reload automatically when you save!

When you're ready to learn more, head over to the [About page](/about) and I'll show you how to create new pages.
