### These docs are always with you

This entire site is embedded in the Hugs binary. Run `hugs doc` and it extracts to a temp folder and serves locally — no internet needed.

```bash
hugs doc                # opens in browser
hugs doc --port 9000    # specific port
hugs doc --no-open      # don't auto-open
hugs doc --dump <PATH>  # Dump the documentation site in a path
```

Available as long as the command runs. `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### Your turn

Hugs stays out of your way. No build pipelines, no plugin ecosystems, no configuration rabbit holes. Markdown files become web pages. That's it.

This tutorial site is a starting point:

- **Delete everything** and start fresh
- **Keep the structure** and replace the content
- **Use it as reference** while building something else

The best way to learn is to build something real. A blog, a portfolio, docs for a side project — pick one and start writing.
